A 3.5mm TRRS audio switch, COM to A or B

I got tired of fumbling around under my desk to switch my audio connection between a headset and a speaker bar so I created a simple 3.5mm TRRS audio switch with KiCad and FreeCAD. 

The PCB was designed in KiCad. The gerbers can be found in gerbers/audio_switch_gerbers.zip and can be sent to any PCB fabricator. The PCB should be made 1.6mm thick to fit with the case. The [toggle switch](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/e-switch/1003P1T1B1M2QEH/378894) and [3.5mm audio jacks](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/tensility-international-corp/54-00174/12140150) are soldered to the PCB. 

The case was designed in FreeCAD. The .step models are available as well as a Bambu Studio file (.3mf) for printing on a Bambu 3D printer. M2.5*4*3.5 threaded heat-set inserts are pressed into the front piece of the case. A vertical heat-set insert press tool makes it much easier to install all of the threaded inserts straight up and down. The back piece of the case is secured with M2.5*10 screws. The case is designed to be mounted with Kreg pocket-hole screws.
